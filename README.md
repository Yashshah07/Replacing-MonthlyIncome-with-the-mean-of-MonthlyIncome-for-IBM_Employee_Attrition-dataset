# Replacing-MonthlyIncome-with-the-mean-of-MonthlyIncome-for-IBM_Employee_Attrition-dataset

Load the “IBM_Employee_Attrition_v3” dataset, from the raw_data module in CANVAS, into R. This is a variation of a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists for predicting employee attrition. Perform the EDA analysis by:<br>
I.	Summarizing each column (e.g. min, max, mean)<br>
II.	Identifying missing values<br>
III.	Displaying the frequency table of “Attrition” vs. “MaritalStatus” <br>
IV.	Displaying the scatter plot of “Age”, “MaritalStatus” and “YearsAtCompany”, one pair at a time<br>
V.	Showing box plots for columns:  “Age”, “MaritalStatus” and “YearsAtCompany”<br>
Replacing the missing values of “MonthlyIncome” with the “mean” of “MonthlyIncome”.<br>
